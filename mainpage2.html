 <ul class="textstyle">
<li> <b>Population</b> 126,700,214 (2019)</li>
<li> <b>Official language</b> - Japanese</li>
<li> Languages spoken <b>99.2% </b>of people in Japan have Japanese as their first language. There are still a few lesser-spoken languages across the islands, including: Amami, Kyukyu, Kikai and Miyako. Some people may speak English in the major cities but it’s not a given.</li>
<li> <b>People</b> -according to the 2018 census, 97.8% of the people of Japan are Japanese, with the remainder being foreign nationals residing in Japan, generally for work. The Ainu people, indigenous to Hokkaido, is about 150,000.</li>
<li> <b>Religion </b> - Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan. It doesn’t believe in one god, but instead that spirits inhabit all things. While not everybody in Japan practices Shinto, it is deeply engraved in their customs and culture. Buddhism is the other main religion in Japan. It arrived in the sixth century from China and has changed and adapted over the centuries. </li>
</ul>
 <p><b>Japan</b> is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.</p>
<p> <b>Japan</b> is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.44 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents. </p>
	   
<h2 id=Policy></i><b>&nbsp;Policy </b></h2> 
<p><b> Japan</b> is a constitutional monarchy governed by the Constitution of 1947. The Emperor is the state symbol. The parliament (the Diet), which holds the legislative power, has a lower chamber, the House of Representatives (480 members), and an upper house, the House of Councilors (242 members). The Prime Minister - the chief executive - is chosen by the parliament and appointed by the Emperor. He appoints and dismisses ministers. The government is composed of a majority of ministers from parliament, and all must be civilians.</p>
 <h2 id=Shopping></i><b>&nbsp;Shopping</b></h2> 
<p><b> Japan</b> is seen as a shoppers paradise. Markets have handmade trinkets and souveniers as well as clothes, shoes and accessories. There are also huge malls with a mix of international brands and Japanese brands but be aware that sizes tend to be quite small, so try everything on if possible.
Take advantage of the many handicraft shops and stalls that you will find in most provincial towns, where you can buy ceramics, lacquer, wood, bamboo, bronze, washi (traditional Japanese paper); origami (folded paper), calligraphy boxes, ukiyo-e paintings (traditional prints), toys and lucky ornaments; clothes and cotton fabric or silk kimonos, beads, dolls; sabers; cakes and confectionery; electronics and cameras. Good quality items can be expensive but you can shop around.</p>
<h2 id=Transportation></i><b>&nbsp;Transportation </b></h2> 
<p><b>Urban transportation</b>:Cost on urban transportation can generally be reduced by planning out your route wisely. On each day, try to concentrate on just one part of the city instead of zigzagging around town. Thereby you can walk in between sights and minimize subway and bus travel. </p>

<p><b>Day passes, regular tickets and prepaid cards</b>: are available for most major Japanese cities. While some day passes are good deals, many others require you to do a lot of traveling before they pay off. As a result, regular tickets are not rarely cheaper than day passes, especially if plan your route wisely. Prepaid IC cards, such as Suica and Icoca, do not provide any discounts over regular tickets, but they are more convenient to use. </p>
<p><b> Bicycles:</b> 
A rental bicycle can be a convenient and economical way of exploring small to medium sized cities, city districts or rural towns.  </p> </div>
